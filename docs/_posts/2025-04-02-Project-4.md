## Project Definition

### Project Overview

This project uses simulated data on Starbucks rewards provided by the Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree. This dataset simulates customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards app. Starbucks periodically sends offers, such as ads for drinks or promotions like discounts or buy one get one free (BOGO). Some users may not receive offers every week.

### Problem Statement

The problem to solve for this dataset is to be able to provide better guidance for what types of offers should be sent to certain groups of users. By being more efficient in providing customers with offers that they’ll want to use and by not sending offers to customers that do not use the offers, costs to the company can be lowered in terms of resources on notifications.

### Metrics

Since my approach to this problem will be without the use of a machine learning model, I will calculate the completion rate for different offer parameters and user groups.

## Analysis

### Data Exploration

There are three JSON files: portfolio.json for promotional offers, profile.json for customer information, and transcript.json for transaction records, including offers received, viewed, and completed per user.

#### Portfolio

The portfolio dataset has information on the offers sent during the 30-day test period. It contains only 10 offers. Each offer iss either a BOGO offer, a discount offer, or just simply information to hopefully entice the customer to go to the store. Additionally, each offer has an associated difficulty, reward, duration, and list of channels. The difficulty for the offer is the minimum required spend to be able to receive the reward for the offer.

In this dataset, there were 4 BOGO offers, 4 discount offers, and 2 informational offers.

In terms of rewards: 2 offers had a reward of 0 (the informational offers); 2 offers had a reward of $2; 1 had a reward of $3; 3 had a reward of $5; and 2 had a reward of $10 (the BOGO offers).

In terms of difficulty, most were $10 and under for the minimum spend, but there was one offer with a minimum spend of $20 with a $5 reward.

Additionally, the duration for most was 7 days or less, with two offers having a duration of 10 days.

### Profile

The profile dataset has 17,000 customers. Each customer had: the ID for the customer; an age (with missing value encoded as 118); the date the customer became a member on; a gender (values could be M, F, O, or null); and the customer income.

There were about 13% of users that did not have gender, age, or income information. About 50% of the dataset has a gender of M, 36% has a gender of F, and 1% has a gender of O. For the remaining demographics, I created grouping columns for the user tenure (whole years based on how long before 2019-01-01 they had become a member), user age groups, and user income groups. The results for those groupings are down below.

Another thing to note is that users of age 45+ make up most of the dataset, with 65+ making up 25% of the dataset, the biggest group of people.

When looking at the users by gender, Male makes up most of the customers with almost 50%. The next group is Female which accounts for 36% of the users. Almost 13% of the users are

### Transcript

The transcript dataset has 306,648 events. Each event has the description of the event: transaction, offer received, offer viewed, or offer completed. Additionally, each event had the customer ID involved, the time of the event, and a value. This value was itself a dictionary that might contain different information based on the type of event. For any event involving an offer, it contains the offer ID associated for the event. If the event was a completed offer, it also contains the reward gained from completing the offer. If the event was a transaction, it contains the transaction amount.

About 45% of the events are transactions. This makes sense since there can be multiple transactions before completing an event and they can occur regardless of offer status. About there are 6 users totaling 20 transactions that never received an offer, so these users would probably have shopped at Starbucks anyways.

## Methodology

For each dataset, there was some cleaning to do. Since the offer duration was recorded as days, while the interaction time was recorded in hours since the start of the evaluation period, I turned the duration into hours as well for easier calculations later. For the users, there would be a lot of smaller combinations if I left the ages, incomes, and member start dates as is, so I created groupings for these as stated above. This also involved changing the user age of 118 back to null (since that it how this is marked). For the user age and user income groups, I used the pandas categorical data type to fill null values with “N/A”. For the interactions dataset, I split out the interaction’s type and information into single rows. I then saved each of these dataframes in a sqlite database to make further processing a little easier.

In order to start collecting the aggregate information, I separated out the interactions table I created by their event type. I then joined them back into each other to try to form a customer journey from them receiving an offer to viewing it, then performing a transaction, and finally completing the offer. I then created flags for whether the customer had a transaction for an offer and if they completed the offer. Since multiple of the same offer could be sent to the same user, I aggregated at the user ID and offer ID level.

With that out of the way, I aggregated by the offer type and one of the 7 features from the offer and user information. These 7 features are user gender, user tenure, user age group, user income, offer duration, offer spend minimum, and offer reward.

## Results

When looking at completion percentage by offer type, more discount offers were completed than BOGO offers.

As discussed above, I chose to look at the completion percentage of offer type by user gender, user tenure, user age group, user income, offer duration, offer spend minimum, or offer reward.

When looking at these aggregations, discount offers tend to have a higher completion rate amongst any user group or offer group. The only cases where this norm is broken are for the group of users that did not provide their gender, age, or income.

## Conclusion

Analyzing this data was tricky due to the little things that needed to be fixed with the data and then trying to piece back together the order of customer interactions in order to figure out if they seemed to be influenced by the offer they received. As an improvement, I think it would be worthwhile to analyze the effect there was on transactions. This proved a little too tricky for me since there are more transactions than received offers.
