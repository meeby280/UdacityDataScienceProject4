# Introduction

## Project Setup

Used Python 3.12.4 and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Data Source

The dataset is provided as part of the project.

The Starbucks data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.
